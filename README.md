## Intro
This is an assignment from [ABB Digital Accelerator](https://new.abb.com/products/robotics/es/customer-innovation-center) in the search for a fullstack developer in the React-NodeJS stack.

**This is the frontend repository** of the assigment.

Both repositories (Frontend and Backend) can be found here:
* ‚öôÔ∏è**Backend repo** go to [backend repo](https://github.com/calamao/abb-test-back)
* üåè**Frontend repo** go to [web-app repo](https://github.com/calamao/abb-test-front)

## Next Steps
This is the 'unified' `next steps section` for the Frontend and the Backend app.

This next steps section is a list of missing features, TODOs in the code or just missalignments with the specified features in the test.

Next steps functionality
* UI
  * Socket
  	* Initialize first and share it through React Context API for example
  	* Get API url through build variable in SocketService
    * Disconnect event listener from Socket when necessary
  * There should be an API client. No 'hardcoded' fetches.
  * Cards Layout
  	* The layout does not correspond exactly with the one in the Test
  	* A simple "flex wrap" layout has been used
  		* This makes the layout responsive for any device width
  	* There feature cards are expanded vertically (there is no wider card like in the proposal)
  * Include UI in Docker environment
  * Use Theme variables for the layout and colors
* Backend
  * Event
  	* After event happens the DB should also be updated
  * SwaggerUI
  	* Update doc with "Part" endpoints
  	* Generate the swagger.json file
  		* https://dev.to/acanimal/express-api-with-autogenerated-openapi-doc-through-swagger-7na
  		* After that generate models in the UI
  * Add Integration Tests
* Others
 * There are of course much more topics to discuss
